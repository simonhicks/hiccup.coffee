# Description

Hiccup is a small library for creating html and css using javascript/json data structures. It's almost a port of clojure's hiccup library, with a bit of gaka and scriptjure thrown in for good measure.


# Usage

## HTML

html is generated by passing nested arrays to the html function. The easiest way to explain is with an example, so this code...

    html(
      ["div.foo", {id: "bar"},
        ["p.foo.bar#baz", "Lorem ipsum dolor consectitur"],
        ["br"],
        ["p", "hopefully this is enough to make the point..."]
      ])

produces this html...

    <div id="bar" class="foo">
       <p id="baz" class="foo bar">
         Lorem ipsum dolor consectitur
       </p>
       <br />
       <p>
         hopefully this is enough to make the point...
       </p>
    </div>

If a function is assigned to an attr, that function is converted to an inline js string. Again, an example is worth a thousand words, so this coffeescript...

    html(
      ["div.foo", {id: "bar", onmouseover: -> doSomethingAwesome()},
        ["p.foo.bar#baz", "Lorem ipsum dolor consectitur"],
        ["br"],
        ["p", "I don't know about you, but I think this is pretty cool!"]
      ])

produces this html...

    <div id="bar" onmouseover="return doSomethingAwesome();" class="foo">
      <p id="baz" class="foo bar">
        Lorem ipsum dolor consectitur
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        I don't know about you, but I think this is pretty cool!
      </p>
    </div>

Finally, if an Array is assigned to an attr, it is passed to css.inline (see below) so you can also do this (although obviously you shouldn't!)

    html(
      ["div.foo", {id: "bar", onmouseover: -> doSomethingAwesome()},
        ["p.foo.bar#baz", "Lorem ipsum dolor consectitur"],
        ["br"],
        ["p", {style: ["color", "red"]}, "I don't know about you, but I think this is pretty cool!"]
      ])

which produces...

    <div id="bar" onmouseover="return doSomethingAwesome();" class="foo">
      <p id="baz" class="foo bar">
        Lorem ipsum dolor consectitur
      </p>
      <br />
      <p style="color: red;">
        I don't know about you, but I think this is pretty cool
      </p>
    </div>


## CSS
    
You can also generate css using the css function. A stylesheet is modelled as an object, while a set of rules is modelled as an array, so this...

    css(
      {
        "div": ["width", "940px",
                "margin", "0 auto"],

        "p": ["background", "#00ff00",
              "color", "#ff0000"]
      })

produces...

    div {
      width: 940px;
      margin: 0 auto;
    }
    p {
      background: #00ff00;
      color: #ff0000;
    }

### Mixins

nested arrays are flattened before the css is produced, so we can use arrays as "mixins". This coffeescript...

    border = (weight, color) ->
      ["border", "#{weight}px solid #{color}"]

    css(
      {
        "div.main": ["width", "940px",
                     border(1, "#000000")]
      })

produces this css...

    div.main {
      width: 940px;
      border: 1px solid #000000;
    }

### Nesting

objects inside a stylesheet array are treated as nested stylesheets, so...

    css(
      {
        "div.main": ["width", "940px"
                     {
                       "p.foo": ["background", "#ff8888"]
                     }]
      })

produces the following css

    div.main {
      width: 940px;
    }
    div.main p.foo {
      background: #ff8888;
    }

### Inline css

If you want to generate css for use in a style attr, you can use the css.inline function like so

    css.inline(["color", "#ff0000", "background", "#00ff00"]) 
    # => "color: #ff0000; background: #00ff00;"
